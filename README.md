- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElliRavenEllingsworth
- 👀 I’m interested in aviation. I more less did a crash course for my private pilots license, in 2 1/2 months. airplane single engine landl (PPL). I more less did a crash course, pardon the expression, and achieved it in 10 weeks. My goal is to become an airline pilot someday, but for now i'm building time to qualify for a
- commercial license, my instrument license, and eventually become a certified flight instructor. All good tickets to have when you go for an ATP, decide to join the military, and if you practice enough I might be fortunate enough to be a part of an elite flying team.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning turboprop and various jets, including the F-14 Tomcat, and FA-18E Super Hornet
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing scenery for Flight Simulator because I want to improve the environment to make it more appealing for future potential pilots. I am also looking for flying partners, interested in doing aerobatics and formation flying with other simmers.
